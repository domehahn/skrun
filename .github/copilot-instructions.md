- `cncf-cedar-reviewer.prompt.md` — Review Cedar using its official documentation and repository in the Provisioning / Security &amp; Compliance category. Cedar is an open source authorization policy language that enables developers to express fine-grained permissions as easy-to-understand policies enforced in their applications, and decouple access control from application logic. Cedar is designed to be ergonomic, fast, safe, and analyzable using automated reasoning. Cedar&#39;s simple and intuitive syntax supports common authorization use-cases with readable policies, naturally expressing concepts from role-based, attribute-based, and relation-based access control models. Cedar&#39;s policy structure enables authorization requests to be decided quickly. Its policy validator uses optional typing to help policy writers avoid mistakes, but not get in their way. Cedar&#39;s design has been finely balanced to allow for a sound, complete, and decidable logical encoding, which enables precise automated analysis of Cedar policies, e.g., to ensure that policy refactoring preserves existing permissions. Cedar&#39;s language specification has been formally verified using a theorem prover to satisfy key security properties like &quot;deny trumps allow,&quot; and its implementation in Rust undergoes rigorous differential random testing against its formal specification. By combining mathematical rigor with developer-friendly design, Cedar offers a practical approach to secure, maintainable authorization for modern applications.

Among other options it enables users to generate a specified query-per-second (QPS) load and records detailed latency histograms, facilitating the analysis of performance metrics. The server component offers a straightforward web UI and REST API, allowing users to initiate tests and visualize results through graphical representations. Beyond load testing, Fortio provides server-side features akin to httpbin, including request echoing with headers, configurable latency or error responses, TCP echoing and proxying, HTTP fan-out, and support for gRPC echo and health checks. These capabilities make Fortio a versatile tool for debugging and testing high-performance services in cloud-native environments. As an organization set of git repositories, is also a growing set of reusable libraries for writing Cloud Native Go code and CLIs.
