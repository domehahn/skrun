# cncf-gardener-reviewer

This is an AI agent skill scaffolded with `skcr`.

## Authoring workflow

1. Define the Goal and identity in `descriptor.yaml`.
2. Define a least-privilege behavioral/security boundary in `contract.yaml`.
3. Write model-facing instructions in `SKILL.md`.
4. Declare MCP/A2A trust boundaries and the reviewed execution closure.
5. Declare ASPS and assurance requirements in `assurance.yaml`.
6. Add behavioral and adversarial scenarios in `evals/`.
7. Run `skcr validate` and `skcr asps coverage cncf-gardener-reviewer`.
8. Run `skcr compile cncf-gardener-reviewer --target skil`.
9. Run `skcr sync` and `skcr version recommend cncf-gardener-reviewer`.

“Never modify files” in `SKILL.md` is guidance. Empty
`capabilities.runtime.allowed.filesystem.write` and `delete` lists in `contract.yaml` are
the authoritative machine-readable boundary. Neither statement alone is runtime
enforcement. `skcr` declares and validates; an external verifier or
runtime must observe and enforce.
