# Claude Code Integration

The Claude Code adapter generates both skills and subagents.

Skills vs. Subagents

Skills are reusable instruction bundles.

.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md

Subagents are specialized Claude Code workers with their own context, tool access, model, permissions, and system prompt.

.claude/agents/<subagent-name>.md
Generated subagents

The DevSecOps SDLC edition generates these Claude Code subagents when the claude platform is enabled:

requirements-analyst
architecture-reviewer
devsecops-reviewer
security-reviewer
ci-cd-reviewer
iac-gitops-reviewer
test-runner
release-readiness-reviewer
incident-postmortem-assistant
Invocation

Claude Code can delegate automatically when a task matches a subagent description.

You can also ask explicitly:

Use the security-reviewer subagent to review this change.

or:

Use the test-runner subagent to run relevant tests and summarize failures.
Design rules
Keep review subagents mostly read-only.
Use explicit tools.
Use skills: to preload relevant skill instructions into subagent context.
Prefer bounded, specialized subagents over generic workers.
Do not use subagents as a replacement for human review on security-sensitive changes.

### Claude Code

Generated files:

```text
CLAUDE.md
.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
.claude/agents/<subagent-name>.md

Claude Code skills provide reusable instructions. Claude Code subagents provide specialized workers with their own context, tools, model, permissions, and preloaded skills.

The Claude adapter generates both:

skills under .claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
subagents under .claude/agents/<subagent-name>.md

Subagents are useful for bounded review, testing, analysis, and DevSecOps tasks that would otherwise flood the main Claude Code conversation with logs, grep output, test output, or detailed review findings.

## Claude Code Instructions

Project: skrun  
Owner team: platform-engineering  
Governance level: standard

## Required behavior

- Make real file changes when implementation is requested.
- Do not only explain how to do the work.
- Do not commit, push, deploy, publish, or merge unless explicitly asked.
- Avoid secrets and sensitive files.
- Keep changes minimal, validated, and reviewable.
- Summarize changed files, validation results, and residual risks.

/cncf-cedar-reviewer — Review Cedar using its official documentation and repository in the Provisioning / Security &amp; Compliance category. Cedar is an open source authorization policy language that enables developers to express fine-grained permissions as easy-to-understand policies enforced in their applications, and decouple access control from application logic. Cedar is designed to be ergonomic, fast, safe, and analyzable using automated reasoning. Cedar&#39;s simple and intuitive syntax supports common authorization use-cases with readable policies, naturally expressing concepts from role-based, attribute-based, and relation-based access control models. Cedar&#39;s policy structure enables authorization requests to be decided quickly. Its policy validator uses optional typing to help policy writers avoid mistakes, but not get in their way. Cedar&#39;s design has been finely balanced to allow for a sound, complete, and decidable logical encoding, which enables precise automated analysis of Cedar policies, e.g., to ensure that policy refactoring preserves existing permissions. Cedar&#39;s language specification has been formally verified using a theorem prover to satisfy key security properties like &quot;deny trumps allow,&quot; and its implementation in Rust undergoes rigorous differential random testing against its formal specification. By combining mathematical rigor with developer-friendly design, Cedar offers a practical approach to secure, maintainable authorization for modern applications.

Among other options it enables users to generate a specified query-per-second (QPS) load and records detailed latency histograms, facilitating the analysis of performance metrics. The server component offers a straightforward web UI and REST API, allowing users to initiate tests and visualize results through graphical representations. Beyond load testing, Fortio provides server-side features akin to httpbin, including request echoing with headers, configurable latency or error responses, TCP echoing and proxying, HTTP fan-out, and support for gRPC echo and health checks. These capabilities make Fortio a versatile tool for debugging and testing high-performance services in cloud-native environments. As an organization set of git repositories, is also a growing set of reusable libraries for writing Cloud Native Go code and CLIs.

Project Subagents

Claude Code project subagents are stored under:

.claude/agents/<subagent-name>.md

Use subagents for bounded side tasks that would otherwise flood the main conversation with file reads, grep results, logs, test output, or security review detail.



requirements-analyst — Use proactively to analyze issues, user stories, acceptance criteria, constraints, risks, and missing requirements before implementation.


architecture-reviewer — Use proactively for architecture, module boundaries, interfaces, coupling, scalability, data flows, and technical design risks.


devsecops-reviewer — Use proactively after code, CI/CD, dependency, IaC, GitOps, or security-sensitive changes to review DevSecOps risk and merge readiness.


security-reviewer — Use proactively for authentication, authorization, input validation, file handling, permissions, secrets, and security-sensitive code changes.


ci-cd-reviewer — Use proactively for GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, runners, deployment jobs, caches, artifacts, tokens, and pipeline governance.


iac-gitops-reviewer — Use proactively for Terraform, Kubernetes, Helm, Kustomize, GitOps, environment promotion, reconciliation, and infrastructure changes.


test-runner — Use proactively to run relevant tests, analyze failures, and summarize validation results after implementation.


release-readiness-reviewer — Use proactively before release readiness claims to review tests, rollback, migrations, feature flags, monitoring, documentation, and breaking changes.


incident-postmortem-assistant — Use for incident analysis, log summaries, timeline reconstruction, root cause analysis, corrective actions, and follow-up issues.

Subagent routing

Use the matching subagent proactively when the task fits its description.

Recommended routing:

Requirements or acceptance criteria unclear → requirements-analyst
Architecture or module boundaries affected → architecture-reviewer
Security-sensitive behavior affected → security-reviewer
CI/CD or deployment logic changed → ci-cd-reviewer
Terraform, Kubernetes, Helm, Kustomize, or GitOps changed → iac-gitops-reviewer
Tests should be executed or failures analyzed → test-runner
DevSecOps merge-readiness review needed → devsecops-reviewer
Release readiness must be assessed → release-readiness-reviewer
Incident, outage, logs, or postmortem analysis needed → incident-postmortem-assistant
SDLC skill routing

For feature work, prefer:

/requirements-analyst
→ /cost-based-planner
→ /architecture-reviewer when architecture is affected
→ /threat-modeler when security-sensitive behavior is affected
→ /safe-implementer
→ /test-strategy-engineer
→ /verification-reviewer
→ /security-reviewer when needed
→ /documentation-maintainer when needed
→ /release-readiness-reviewer before release readiness claims

For CI/CD, dependency, IaC, GitOps, secrets, compliance, observability, or incident tasks, use the matching specialized skill or subagent before claiming completion.

Safety model
Prefer read-only subagents for analysis and review.
Use implementation through the main Claude Code session unless a subagent is explicitly designed to modify files.
Do not let review subagents perform broad rewrites.
Treat subagent output as review input; the main session remains responsible for final user-visible conclusions.
